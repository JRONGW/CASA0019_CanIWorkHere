                    </span> We measure three types of real-time data to provide an insight into the studying/working
                    environment for users. The noise level is sensed by an MAX9814 sound sensor, converting sound
                    amplitude into an absolute decibel. The Wi-Fi signal strength of eduroam, which is the most commonly
                    used network in universities, is scanned by an ESP32 board. The estimated number of people around is
                    ?

                    <br>
                    The sensor and the board are installed in a sensing box. The real-time data with a ? second interval
                    is transferred from the sensing box to a separate gauge and a corresponding app through MQTT for
                    better visualisation, helping users intuitively directed to the information.

                <p><span class="title_content">DATA DEVICE (Physical)<br />
                    </span> There are two physical devices for our project: a sensor box and a real-time gauge. We aim
                    to provide a flexible user experience that
                    lets users freely choose where to sense the data and where to install the gauge. For instance, users
                    can install the sensor box in the centre of a shared working environment while placing the gauge in
                    a spacious area, facilitating everyone to come and see.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The sensor box contains a MAX9814 sound sensor and an ESP32 board to collect real-time data and
                    transmit it to the MQTT broker. The gauge dial plate indicates the real-time sound level from the
                    sensor box with a pointer, ranging from 30dB to 90dB. (We can add more details, such as the green to
                    the red colour of the dial plate.) The LED strip on the bottom of the gauge indicates the Wi-Fi
                    signal strength. This helps users quickly see if a weak connection is caused by the network or their
                    devices themselves. Both the progressive colour system (from red to green) and the number of
                    illuminated LEDs provide immediate visual feedback to users. The LED strip follows the working rule
                    as below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>-70 ~ -80 dBm: One red LED light on.</li>
                    <li>-60 ~ -70 dBm: Two orange LED lights on.</li>
                    <li>-50 ~ -60 dBm: Three yellow LED lights on.</li>
                    <li>-40 ~ -50 dBm: Four lime green LED lights on.</li>
                    <li>-30 ~ -40 dBm: Five green LED lights on.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By combining noise and Wi-Fi monitoring in a single display, users can make decisions about their
                    studying/working environment intuitively.

                <p><span class="title_content">DATA DEVICE (Digital)<br />
                    </span> The app's dashboard consists three main visual elements. On the top left, we have a 24-hour
                    historical view of sound and Wi-Fi intensity. Below that, the bottom-left chart shows real-time data
                    streamed via MQTT over the last minute. In the bottom-right corner, a four-quadrant chart analyzes
                    the environment to offer study suggestions based on signal and noise levels. Current real-time
                    values are displayed in the top-right corner of the dashboard, and the estimated number of people in
                    the classroom is shown on the far left.
